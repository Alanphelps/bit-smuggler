attack opportunities analyzed as a funnel

Intuitively, each particular behaviour of a BitSmuggler connection
narrows down the investigation space for a network censor.

Such signs could be.
eg:
 * it only uses uTorrent 
 * if all files are exchanged within swarm of size 2, with a single connection
to the other peer in the swarm it means that an adversary maybe can count
connections for the same infohash (pattermatch for the bittorrent header)
and narrow down to all bitTorrent connections that use a single other
peer to get thier file data

Some signs are are easier to check or are a strong give away (the presence of
a particular constant string in the data being exchanged is almost certain
immediate give away.)

Some cannot be checked at wire speed but may be checked on a slow path.
(eg. is the file really a video file as it claims to be? or is it just a blob
of encrypted data?)

=== File exchanges ===

Methods:

1. setup a file exchange in a swarm of size 2 leechers
   (the server and the client)

pros:
  * no outside interference
  * maximal throughput
  * simplest to implement
  * 

2.


=== Information leaks ===

reverse proxying DHT leak - UNCONFIRMED

when reverse proxied the peer connection comes from localhost.

does this info end up leaking outside? because if it does it's a sure
sign that bitSmuggler is being used.

This is most likely not a problem. suppose the DHT logic may attempt to make
 note of a new swarm member based on an incoming connection. the IP is
 solveable but it does not know, which is the port the peer coming in is 
listening on.

This is verifiable, but most likely a peer record ends up in the DHT only if 
someone advertises it, and usually the peer always advertises itself - aka i 
don't think the receiver will say "here's another peer that i know of" to 
the DHT.
