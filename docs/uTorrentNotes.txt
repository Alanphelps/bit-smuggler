uTorrent reverse engineering notes
=================================

Observations

== Connection cut on big files ==
* when seed -> peer transfer a ~1GB file the connection is cut every
~250mb and remade. it seems as though it may not use the same tcp connection
to transmit the whole file.
 
not sure if there is a traceable cause for this. however, it is something that
can occur so it should be dealt with.

== utorrent is stateful ==

state stored in dht.dat and so on blabla.dat influences whether connections are
succesful or not (some peers may be classified as bad).

attempt to reconnect without clearing state may affect future behaviour.
