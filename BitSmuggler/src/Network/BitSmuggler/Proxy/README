Proxy server and client for TCP connections
===========================================

Example use case
----------------

Use the client to proxy all your browser traffic through it
to a remote server proxy that makes connections for you.


Design
------

Not being used just with Tor means that you may not care about
anonimity but you might care only about getting across a internet
censor therefore you don't care about what apps you proxy.
(unlike the case with Tor, where proxying certain apps mean
 you ruin your anonimty. eg. bittorrent)

Options:
  1. make it a socks proxy just like tor
  2. find a better way? (yeah i know, very clear)
